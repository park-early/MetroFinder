# MetroFinder

### 210 Project by Parker Lee

**MetroFinder** is a metro navigation app, meant to help users familiarize themselves with various rapid transit 
networks around the world. Users will be able to:

- Find information about lines
- Find information about individual stations
- Find information about transfers
- Plan and save routes
- Learn about cities through their metro systems

This app is suitable for users who are interested in travel, especially those who are keen on visiting
urban cities with bustling subway lines, or anyone who is just intrigued by metro systems.

*Why is this of interest to me?*

I'm fascinated by metro systems and how they manage to operate in conjunction with each other, so I wanted to create
an app that fuels that interest while being practical. As someone who has an interest to travel outside of Canada
(and got denied that luxury recently), this app also serves as an opportunity for me to learn more about
transportation in cities I plan to visit, while also testing my programming skills.
